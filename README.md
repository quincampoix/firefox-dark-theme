# Quincampoix dark
My personal firefox theme. You can find it on Mozilla themes by searching "Quincampoix dark"

This theme is based on "Matte Black (red)" : https://github.com/elibroftw/matte-black-theme with the following changes :
- Added Toolbar field highlight customization (custom blue-ish color instead of firefox default)
- Tab red color slightly darker
